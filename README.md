# SQL-examples
A demonstration of querying a database using SQL (database from https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx/)

The databased used here provides information about customers, orders, and shipment in a company across 2.5 years.
In my examples, I locate and organize customer information, sales, and shipping days, to demonstrate my abiliy to pull this information across multiple tables in a database, and compare it in a readable way.
